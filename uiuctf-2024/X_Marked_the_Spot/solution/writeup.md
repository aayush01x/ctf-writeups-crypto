The key is of 8 bytes and we know first 7 bytes of the flag. Also notice that flag length is integer multiple of key length, so key will completely map to the flag when repeated. Hence last byte of key will be xorred with last byte of flag, which is known '}'. As we know all 8 bytes which are sufficient to get the key from the output in ct, we can obtain the key and hence the flag.

exploit.py
```python3
from itertools import cycle
with open("../ct", "rb") as ct_file: #replace '../ct' with ct's file location 
    ct = ct_file.read()
key_len = 8
start = b'uiuctf{'
end = b'}'
key = bytes(ct[i]  ^ start[i] for i in range(7)) + bytes([ct[-1]^ end[0]]) 
flag = bytes(x ^ y for x, y in zip(ct, cycle(key)))
print(flag.decode())
```

**Flag**: `uiuctf{n0t_ju5t_th3_st4rt_but_4l50_th3_3nd!!!!!}`
